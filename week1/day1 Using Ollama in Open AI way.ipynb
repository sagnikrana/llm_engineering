Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

Some of the key values in this object include:\\n\\n* `appVersion`: The version number of the application (usweb-1.231.3-62d525b7b0c34941587ba19e1e5d087f1a297d0e-O60116r)\\n* `dataCenter`: The data center where the application is hosted (wus2)\\n* Various other settings, such as `oidcParams`, `threatMetrix`, and `membershipConfig`\\n\\n**Settings**\\n\\nSome of the notable settings in this JSON object include:\\n\\n* `clientId`: A unique identifier for the client-side application\\n* `scope`: The scope of access granted to the client-side application (openid email offline_access)\\n* `tenantId`: The ID of the tenant where the application is hosted (elh9ie)\\n* `redirectUri`: The URL that the client-side application will redirect to after authorization\\n\\n**Other Settings**\\n\\nThere are several other settings in this JSON object, including:\\n\\n* `googleMaps`: Configuration for Google Maps integration\\n* `perimeterX`: Configuration for Perimeter X security services\\n* `identity`: Configuration for user identity and authentication\\n* `authFrameRoutes`: Routes for authentication frames\\n\\nOverall, this HTML document appears to be a client-side application that uses various settings and configuration data to function.

For example, Selenium is a hugely popular framework that runs a browser behind the scenes, renders the page, and allows you to query it. If you have experience with Selenium, Playwright or similar, then feel free to improve the Website class to use them.
